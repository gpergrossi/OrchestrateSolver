# OrchestrateSolver
This is a C# project that solves the game [Orchestrate](https://gamesforcrows.itch.io/orchestrate) (as seen in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/n5fb3i/we_made_a_game_purely_in_p5js_orchestrate_is_a/) Reddit thread).

I used this project as an excuse to learn some C# profiling tools.

## Findings
- The game has 1326 solutions.
- The shortest solution only uses 6 letters and none of them are the freebie letters 'T' or 'M', which generate wood and stone at zero cost. (Cool)
- No solution uses the letter 'O'.

## Solutions
See `Solutions.txt` for a full list of solutions.
